--------------SERVER----------------

1. Update server endpoint to remove post
   HINT: is very similiar to patch endpoint, you don't need to send any data
         just provide post "id" in request params.
2. find index of post in array and remove post
3. to remove post from array you can use funtion "splice"
4. write file with initialData...

--------------CLIENT----------------

1. Create new action "deletePost" expect to receive "id" of post in arguments of  this function.
2. Find post index in array and if index is found send request to delete post
   HINT: this.$axios.$delete('endpoint')
3. In "then" block after promise is resolved commit mutation to remove post from list, use "splice" once more
4. after delete button is clicked dispatch action "deletePost"

NOTE: One issue is expected. After post will be deleted, activePost will have still old value of deleted post.
Don't worry about this issue right now. Bonus points if you can resolve it. In any case we will fix it in next lecture.
